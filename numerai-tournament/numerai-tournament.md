# The Numerai Tournament

Numerai, founded in San Francisco in 2015, is a global equity hedge fund that trades a meta model based on an aggregation of thousands of predictions made by a global network of competing data scientists. Because each user stakes on their predictions and bad predictions have their stakes destroyed, Numerai can gauge the confidence of the anonymous competitors.
