# FAQ

**I lost my MFA device, can you help recover my account?**

For security reasons, Numerai will never recover an account that is secured with MFA. This is to prevent others from impersonating and taking over your account. We recognize that this is not the best user experience, but because large amounts of money accounts can hold, we must prioritize security above all else.

Some users choose not to enable MFA at all. This is not recommended as it decreases the security of your account.

In order order to secure your account with MFA but not risk losing your account when you lose your device, you just need to save your recovery codes in a safe place. You can either save it in a password manager or on a piece of paper.
