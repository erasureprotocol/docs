Using the blockchain, we have a solution to the market collapse problem.

Erasure is an open protocol for building invincible data feeds.

The aim of the film is to show that streams can come from anyone and contain anything. The brand’s visual identity is around simple solid colors.

Streams, depicted as fast growing tendrils of colorful, low-poly geometric shapes, burst out of rudimentary mocap human forms. The stream’s head, leading the stream, flying and spiralling through space, conveys the data content of the feed.

The film goes on to feature interview dialogue with Fred Ehrsam \(Coinbase Cofounder, Paradigm Partner\) and Richard Craib \(CEO and Founder of Numerai\).
