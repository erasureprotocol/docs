# Authereum

**Authereum is a cryptocurrency wallet** like MetaMask. Unlike MetaMask it does not require a browser addon, so works on any device like your phone or tablet. You can use your Authereum account to [deposit money](../erasurebay-docs/faq.md#how-do-i-deposit-money) to Erasure Bay.

Authereum is a non-custodial wallet which means no one but you has access to your money. Authereum makes it easy for non-technical users to keep their currency secure while providing advanced features. Read [here](https://medium.com/authereum/authereum-key-architecture-explained-8e0781cf3ea0) for a more advanced understanding of Authereum‚Äôs contract-account architecture.

Erasure Bay does not currently support MetaMask.
